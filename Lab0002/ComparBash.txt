When it came to dealig with bash it was a lot more difficult than I was expecting to
replicate the functionality of my java program. It required far more learning about syntax
and how the terminal environment worked than I would have imagined. Habits I had developed from 
programming in java had easily carried over to scripting and debugging became difficult due to seeing
naturally seeing my java syntax as acceptable. It took me less lines of code in Bash to collect user
input but navicgating java was much easier. Computing arithmetic was much more difficult because
in java there are already APIs that make it possible for me to skip some of arithmatic heavy lifting.
